Challenges faced while integrating audio cloning:
Library Compatibility: The libraries were not functional on Python 3.12, which I was using. They worked on Python 3.10, so including the TTS logic in the same script was not possible. Short Subtitles: The libraries needed a longer sample audio to clone the voice better. Some of the subtitles were short, leading to errors in generating the audio for those subtitles.

      <p>This is an extension of the <a href="/projects/video-translator">Video Translator</a> tool that generates cloned audio for short subtitles, improving the quality of audio output. The tool uses the <a href="https://github.com/myshell-ai/OpenVoice">OpenVoice</a> and <a href="https://github.com/myshell-ai/MeloTTS">Melo TTS</a> libraries to clone the audio output generated by the video translator tool.</p>
<p>Challenges faced while integrating audio cloning:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Library Compatibility</strong>: The libraries were not functional on Python 3.12, which I was using. They worked on Python 3.10, so including the TTS logic in the same script was not possible.</li>
<li><strong>Short Subtitles</strong>: The libraries needed a longer sample audio to clone the voice better. Some of the subtitles were short, leading to errors in generating the audio for those subtitles. I cloned the OpenVoice repository and updated the checks that required longer audio samples. I also added a check to skip the subtitles that were too short.</li>
</ol>
<p>Fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>openvoice/se_extractor.py</code> had a check that to avoid saving audio segments which are shorter than 1.5 seconds. Some of the words like <code>hello</code>, <code>hi</code>, <code>bye</code> were shorter than that. I updated the check to allow audio segments which are shorter than 0.5 seconds as well.</li>
<li>Since the <code>openvoice</code> library had explicitly mentioned in the documentation to install melo-tts, I included it in the requirements.txt file.</li>
<li>Added a script where I can configure the path or <code>video-translator</code> tool output folder and run the audio cloning logic on all the audio files generated by the video translator tool.</li>
</ul>
<p>The fork is available at <a href="https://github.com/pratts/OpenVoice">OpenVoice</a> in case you want to use it in your own projects. The <code>test1.py</code> file can be used to clone the audio output generated by the video translator tool.</p>
